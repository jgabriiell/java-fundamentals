# Java fundamentals
This project was created with the aim to practice Java main concepts. The main goal is to challange myself to see if I'm able to create a complete CRUD project with pure Java, without any framework.
Concepts reviwed:
# Object-oriented programming
# Collections framework
# Exception handling
# Separation of concern

With it, I could put my Java knowlegde in practice and make sure I can move on.
